# DCShadow attack description

## Overview

A DC Shadow attack is a technique used by attackers to introduce a rogue domain controller into an Active Directory (AD) environment. This rogue DC replicates with legitimate domain controllers, allowing attackers to make unauthorized changes to AD data, including user permissions and security policies. This attack is designed to be stealthy and difficult to detect, making it a serious threat to AD security. The attack leverages the AD replication process, exploiting it to silently manipulate the directory.
